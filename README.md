# DSAFinalProject
This Data structure and algorithm project is made with python using tkinter for Graphic User Interface(GUI). This is basically spelling checker. If you give wrong input means misspelled word, it will give you maximum of 5 suggestions of words (you can change it by changing maxsuggestion in suggestword function from 1 to upto to your choice).
The following Data Sutructure concepts are used:
1.Binary Search Tree(BST):(for storing suggested words)
2.Linnked List
3.Quick Sort Algorithm
4.Inorder Traversal for BST
5.Levenshtien Distance(it gives minimum nubers of edits(insertion,deletion,substitution) performed on a single char).
